        <h3>Are there any task posting guidelines?</h3>

        <p>
          The Taklief platform helps you get more done. To create a safe,
          respectful and rewarding environment, we need you to follow the
          Guidelines below.
        </p>

        <h6>
          <strong>A. Tasks must be legal</strong>
        </h6>

        <p>
          To ensure a safe and secure experience for all our members, all tasks
          posted must be legal. Soliciting, inducing or encouraging illegal acts
          are strictly prohibited. Scams are also not tolerated on Taklief and
          will be removed.
        </p>

        <h6>B. Prohibited items list</h6>

        <p>
          Tasks must not relate to weapons or unlawful activity, which may
          result in furtherance of a crime. Any requests relating to drugs,
          including prescription drugs or drug paraphernalia is prohibited. Not
          only may these activities have serious legal ramifications, but they
          are also against the spirit and values of Taklief.
        </p>

        <h6>C. No escort or adult services</h6>

        <p>
          Escort, adult services and massage tasks are strictly prohibited on
          Taklief. This includes tasks or comments which are obscene or sexually
          explicit in nature. Whilst we are pushing boundaries and helping to
          reimagine the future of employment, we draw the line here.
        </p>

        <h6>D. Clear scope, time and budget required</h6>

        <p>
          To help get your tasks completed, it’s important that your task has a
          clear scope, time and budget.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Scope:</strong>&nbsp;The task description should clearly, and
          thoroughly, state what it is that you need done. Adding as much
          information as possible helps the Tasker understand expectations.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Time:</strong>&nbsp;Does the task need to be completed on a
          specific day or can it be flexible with the Tasker? If specific,
          mention in task description.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Budget:</strong>&nbsp;Setting a fair price for the amount of
          time and effort required for the task is crucial. Taklief does not
          endorse low pricing of tasks and a task may be moderated, if found to
          be.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <br />
          <li>
            These help Taskers to know whether they have the skills and
            availability to complete your task. It will also help avoid any
            misunderstandings about expectations along the way.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>E. Task based posts</h6>

        <p>
          The Taklief platform is a task based platform that encourages you to
          outsource all the weird and quirky things you might need done on any
          given day. However, there are a few types of tasks that are not
          supported to maintain the integrity of the platform. Tasks that are
          deceitful in nature are not allowed. This includes but is not limited
          to requesting fake business reviews, social media likes and follows.
          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp;
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Example 1:</strong>&nbsp;Sarah posted a task asking Taskers
            to leave 5 star reviews on her company's website and Google maps.
            Sarah’s task was immediately cancelled from Taklief and she was
            advised her task did not follow the Community Guidelines. Academic
            activities and assignment based tasks are strictly prohibited. This
            includes but is not limited to completing an assignment, test or
            course on someones behalf. Additionally, academic assistance in the
            form of proofreading, editing, planning, structuring, referencing
            and giving feedback on someone else's academic work is also not
            supported.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Example 2:</strong>&nbsp;Ahmed posted a task requesting a
            Tasker to proofread his assignment which was a 1,000 word essay on
            the French Revolution. Ahmed was contacted shortly after posting his
            task and advised the post had been cancelled, as it was a
            proofreading task and therefore not supported on Taklief. We also
            don’t allow tasks that request quotes for work to be done outside of
            Taklief.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Example 3:</strong>&nbsp;Saud posted a minimum priced task
            asking for a Tasker to come to his home and give him a quote to
            paint his 3 bedroom house. The task was cancelled by Taklief because
            it was asking for a quote and not for someone to actually paint the
            house. Tasks that require someone to be nude, topless or wear
            clothing like lingerie, swimwear and gym wear are not supported.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Example 4:</strong>&nbsp;Joanne posted a task looking for a
            Tasker to model for a bikini photoshoot. The task was cancelled as
            the Tasker would be required to wear a bikini. Tasks that involve
            investigating or gathering information on an individual or business
            without their knowledge and consent are not supported. Debt
            collection tasks are also not supported. Tasks that ask for someone
            to withdraw cash, buy gift cards, vouchers for the Poster or to send
            money to the Poster via methods like direct bank transfers or STCPay
            are not supported.

          <strong>F. No advertising</strong>
        </h6>

        <p>
          We support businesses outsourcing tasks on Taklief to help their
          business grow, however Taklief is not a platform for business
          advertisements, nor a job board for permanent job ads. Taklief is also
          not a platform for any requests to be employed.fdgsfdg

            <strong>Example 1:</strong>Faris posted a task asking for a
            part-time or full-time job as a builder. The task was removed by
            Taklief as job requests are not supported in the Taklief platform
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Example 2:</strong>&nbsp;Amanda owns a driving school and
            posted a task looking for full-time driving instructors, with an
            hourly rate. Amanda’s task was removed as it was considered a
            business advertisement therefore not supported in the Taklief
            platform .
