        <h3>Principles of a Professional Service Provider (Tasker)</h3>

        <p>
          At Taklief, we seek to build a professional community capable of
          providing quality services with high quality and competitive value, in
          a safe environment that guarantees rights for all parties and
          encourages the development of the service sector in the Kingdom under
          one platform.
          <br />
          <br />
          Among the most prominent criteria that characterize the Taklief
          Professional Society:
        </p>

        <h6>Be professional</h6>

        <p>
          Present yourself professionally when building your account on the
          platform, including writing a profile about you that makes the service
          applicant trust the quality of your work and assigns you the tasks
          they need.
        </p>

        <h6>Be trustworthy</h6>

        <p>
          The conversation between the two parties is a binding contract that
          may be referred to in the event of a dispute after the provision of
          the service; Then the case will be studied and evaluated, then the
          necessary action will be taken to ensure the rights of everyone and
          preserve the values of our society.
        </p>

        <h6>Be ready</h6>

        <p>
          The speed of response is one of the most important criteria for
          community satisfaction; So be ready to get the tasks done, taking the
          initiative to follow up on the latest required tasks on the Taklief
          platform.
        </p>

        <h6>Be helpful</h6>

        <p>
          Make sure that you are a provider of assistance rather than a service
          provider in exchange for money; So cooperate with the seekers of your
          services.
        </p>

        <h6>Be proud</h6>

        <p>
          You provide distinguished services and seek to diversify your sources
          of income; So cherish your skills and invest them by diversifying your
          sources of income.
        </p>

        <h6>Be clear</h6>

        <p>
          Expect that the requester does not know the exact details of its
          implementation; So be clear and suggest the mechanism of action that
          suits them.
        </p>

        <h6>Be fair</h6>

        <p>
          Estimate the cost of implementing the service that qualifies you to
          compete for the assignment of work to you, in a way that ensures
          fairness between the two parties and does not negatively affect the
          quality of work.
