            1.1 Taklief provides the Taklief Platform to enable Posters to
            publish Posted Tasks.

          {/* <br /> */}
          <li className="m-0 p-0">
            1.2 Taskers may make an Offer in response to a Posted Task. Some
            parts of Offer details may be made publicly available, including to
            internet users who are not Users.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.3 A Poster may revoke or modify a Posted Task at any time before
            he/she accepts an Offer. Taklief reserves the right to cancel all
            Offers on a Posted Task made prior to the modification.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.4 If a Poster accepts an Offer on the Taklief Platform, a Task
            Contract is created between the Tasker and the Poster.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.5 Upon creation of a Task Contract, the Poster must pay the Agreed
            Price into the Payment Account.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.6 Upon creation of the Task Contract, Taklief has rendered Taklief
            Services and the Service Fee is due and payable.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.7 Once the Task Contract is created, the Tasker and Poster may
            vary the Task Contract on the Taklief Platform. The Poster and
            Tasker are encouraged to use Taklief's private messaging system to
            amend or vary the Task Contract (including the Agreed Price) or to
            otherwise communicate.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.8 Once the Services are complete, the Tasker must provide notice
            of that on the Taklief Platform.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.9 Once the Services are complete, the Poster must provide notice

          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.10 Once the Posted Task has been completed and the Poster confirms
            the Services are completed, or if Taklief is satisfied the Services
            have been completed, the Tasker Funds will be released by Taklief
            from the Payment Account to the Tasker. However this process does
            not apply to the payment of Recurring Services which is addressed in
            clause 1.16 below.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.11 After the Task Contract is completed, the parties are
            encouraged to review and provide feedback of the Services on the
            Taklief Platform.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.12 Taklief may also provide a Search Assist feature enabling
            Posters to submit an Offer for Services.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.13 An Offer submitted by a Poster using Search Assist may be
            notified to other Users and such Users may elect to make an Instant
            Claim of it.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.14 When using Search Assist a Task Contract is created when a
            Tasker makes an Instant Claim (and in the case of Recurring Services
            a Task Contract is created for the first Occurrence only). For
            Recurring Services, the next Task Contract is created upon
            completion of the previous Occurrence.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.15 A Poster may revoke or modify its Offer in using Search Assist,
            including for Recurring Services, at any time before a Tasker makes
            an Instant Claim. Taklief reserves the right to cancel all Posted
            Tasks made prior to the revocation or modification.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.16 For Recurring Services and subject to clause 1.17, once the
            Occurrence has been completed and the Tasker confirms the Occurrence
            is completed (or if Taklief is satisfied the Occurrence is
            completed) then the Tasker Funds for that Occurrence will
            automatically be released by Taklief from the Payment Account to the
            Tasker.
          </li>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <li>
            1.17 The Poster may elect to pause automatic payment of Tasker Funds
            for an Occurrence within 24 hours from when the Tasker confirms the
            Occurrence is completed. If the Poster pauses such automatic payment
            in accordance with this clause, then the Tasker Funds will not be
            released by Taklief from the Payment Account to the Tasker until the
            Poster also confirms that the Occurrence is completed.

            11.5 You acknowledge and agree that in the event that a claim is
            made relating to any services performed and/or goods provided by a
            Tasker, and the insurance taken out by Taklief (if any) responds to
            that claim then this clause applies. If a claim is made against a
            Tasker, Taklief may (provided that the Tasker consents) elect to
            make a claim under any applicable policy and if the claim is
            successful, Taklief reserves its right to recover any excess or
            deductible payable in respect of the claim from the Tasker. Where
            Taklief makes a claim and the insurer assesses that the Tasker is
            responsible, Taklief is entitled to rely on that assessment. If You
            do not pay any excess due under this clause, Taklief may also elect
            to set this amount off some or all of the excess paid by it against
            future moneys it may owe to You. 11.6 You acknowledge and agree that
            in the event that a claim is made relating to any services performed
            and/or goods provided by a Tasker, and the insurance taken out by
            Taklief (if any) does not respond to the claim or the claim is below
            the excess payable to the insurer, then this clause applies. Taklief
            may elect to reject or pay an amount to settle a claim not covered
            by Taklief's own insurance policies. To the extent that the Tasker
            was or would be liable for the amount of the claim, if Taklief
            elects to pay an amount to settle the claim the amount paid by
            Taklief may be recovered by Taklief from the Tasker. Taklief may
            also elect to set this amount off against future moneys it may owe
            to the Tasker.
