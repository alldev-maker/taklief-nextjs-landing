        <h6>1. SCOPE OF TAKLIEF SERVICES</h6>

        <ul>
          <li>
            1.1 Taklief provides the Taklief Platform to enable Posters to
            publish Posted Tasks.
            <br />
            1.2 Taskers may make an Offer in response to a Posted Task. Some
            parts of Offer details may be made publicly available, including to
            internet users who are not Users.
            <br />
            1.3 A Poster may revoke or modify a Posted Task at any time before
            he/she accepts an Offer. Taklief reserves the right to cancel all
            Offers on a Posted Task made prior to the modification.
            <br />
            1.4 If a Poster accepts an Offer on the Taklief Platform, a Task
            Contract is created between the Tasker and the Poster.
            <br />
            1.5 Upon creation of a Task Contract, the Poster must pay the Agreed
            Price into the Payment Account.
            <br />
            1.6 Upon creation of the Task Contract, Taklief has rendered Taklief
            Services and the Service Fee is due and payable.
            <br />
            1.7 Once the Task Contract is created, the Tasker and Poster may
            vary the Task Contract on the Taklief Platform. The Poster and
            Tasker are encouraged to use Taklief's private messaging system to
            amend or vary the Task Contract (including the Agreed Price) or to
            otherwise communicate.
            <br />
            1.8 Once the Services are complete, the Tasker must provide notice
            of that on the Taklief Platform.
            <br />
            1.9 Once the Services are complete, the Poster must provide notice
            of that on the Taklief Platform.
            <br />
            1.10 Once the Posted Task has been completed and the Poster confirms
            the Services are completed, or if Taklief is satisfied the Services
            have been completed, the Tasker Funds will be released by Taklief
            from the Payment Account to the Tasker. However this process does
            not apply to the payment of Recurring Services which is addressed in
            clause 1.16 below.
            <br />
            1.11 After the Task Contract is completed, the parties are
            encouraged to review and provide feedback of the Services on the
            Taklief Platform.
            <br />
            1.12 Taklief may also provide a Search Assist feature enabling
            Posters to submit an Offer for Services.
            <br />
            1.13 An Offer submitted by a Poster using Search Assist may be
            notified to other Users and such Users may elect to make an Instant
            Claim of it.
            <br />
            1.14 When using Search Assist a Task Contract is created when a
            Tasker makes an Instant Claim (and in the case of Recurring Services
            a Task Contract is created for the first Occurrence only). For
            Recurring Services, the next Task Contract is created upon
            completion of the previous Occurrence.
            <br />
            1.15 A Poster may revoke or modify its Offer in using Search Assist,
            including for Recurring Services, at any time before a Tasker makes
            an Instant Claim. Taklief reserves the right to cancel all Posted
            Tasks made prior to the revocation or modification.
            <br />
            1.16 For Recurring Services and subject to clause 1.17, once the
            Occurrence has been completed and the Tasker confirms the Occurrence
            is completed (or if Taklief is satisfied the Occurrence is
            completed) then the Tasker Funds for that Occurrence will
            automatically be released by Taklief from the Payment Account to the
            Tasker.
            <br />
            1.17 The Poster may elect to pause automatic payment of Tasker Funds
            for an Occurrence within 24 hours from when the Tasker confirms the
            Occurrence is completed. If the Poster pauses such automatic payment
            in accordance with this clause, then the Tasker Funds will not be
            released by Taklief from the Payment Account to the Tasker until the
            Poster also confirms that the Occurrence is completed.

            of this Agreement) is detrimental to the operation of the Taklief
            Platform.
            <br />
            2.5 Registering and creating an account with Taklief is free. There

            <br />

                or unlawful images; or

                not limited to viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs,
                cancelbots, easter eggs or other computer programming routines
                that may damage, modify, delete, detrimentally interfere with,
                surreptitiously intercept, access without authority or
                expropriate any system, data or Personal Information.
              </li>
              <br />
              <br />

              <li>&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            3.8 Taklief Platform may from time to time engage location-based or
            map-based functionality. The Taklief Platform may display the
            location of Posters and Taskers to persons browsing the Taklief
            Platform. A Poster should never disclose personal details such as
            the Poster's full name, street number, phone number or email address
            in a Posted Task or in any other public communication on the Taklief
            Platform.
            <br />
            3.9 If You are a Tasker, You must have the right to provide Services
            under a Task Contract and to work in the jurisdiction where the
            Services are performed. You must comply with VAT and regulatory
            obligations in relation to any payment (including Tasker Funds)
            received under a Task Contract.
            <br />
            3.10 You must not, when supplying Services, charge a Poster any fees
            on top of the Tasker Funds. However, the parties to a Task Contract
            may agree to amend the Agreed Price through the Taklief Platform.
            <br />
            3.11 You must not request payments outside of the Taklief Platform
            from the Poster for the Services except to the extent permitted by
            clause 3.12 and only if the Taklief Platform does not facilitate the
            reimbursement via the Payment Account of costs considered in clause
            3.12.
            <br />
            3.12 If a Tasker agrees to pay some costs of completing the Services
            (such as equipment to complete the Services), the Tasker is solely
            responsible for obtaining any reimbursement from the Poster. Taklief
            advises Taskers not to agree to incur costs in advance of receiving
            the payment for these costs, unless the Tasker is confident the
            Poster will reimburse the costs promptly.
            <br />
            3.13 For the proper operation of the Taklief Platform (including
            insurance, proper pricing and compliance with Policies), the Tasker
            must ensure that, if it subcontracts any part of the performance of
            the Services to a third party in accordance with a Task Contract,
            then that third party must also be a registered User of the Taklief
            Platform.
            <br />
            3.14 If Taklief determines at its sole discretion that You have
            breached any obligation under this clause 3 or that You have
            breached one or more Task Contracts, it reserves the rights to
            remove any content, Posted Task or Offer You have submitted to the
            Taklief Service or cancel or suspend Your account and/or any Task
            Contracts.

        <ul>
          <li>
            4.1 Upon the creation of a Task Contract, the Tasker and Poster each
            owes Taklief the respective portion of the Service Fee. The Service
            Fee will automatically be deducted from the Agreed Price held in the
            Payment Account.
            <br />
            4.2 If the Posted Task requires a Tasker to incur costs in
            completing the Services, the cost incurred will not be included in
            any calculation of Fees.
            <br />
            4.3 Fees do not include any fees that may be due to Third Party

            Service provider.

            non-refundable, save for Your rights under any Non-Excludable
            Conditions.
            <br />
            4.5 If Taklief introduces a new service on the Taklief Platform, the
            Fees applying to that service will be payable as from the launch of
            the service.
            <br />
            4.6 Taklief may set-off any Fees against any Tasker Funds or other

            Agreed Price should be returned to the Poster then the Agreed Price
            will be refunded to the Poster as Stored Value and a Cancellation
            Admin Fee will be due to Taklief by the User who the cancellation of
            the Task Contract is attributable to under clause 5.5 or 5.6.

            to the Tasker.
            <br />
            5.4 Any outstanding Cancellation Admin Fee owed by a User under

                to contact a Tasker to perform the Task Contract, the Task
                Contract is cancelled by the Poster; or

            under the Task Contract, it is the responsibility of the party
            aggrieved to claim any amount owed directly from the other.
            <br />
            5.8 Taklief may take up to 14 days to return the Agreed Price (less
            the Cancellation Admin Fee, if applicable) to the Poster.

            otherwise made to the Tasker or returned to the Poster (as the case
            may be) or no claim is otherwise made for the Tasker Funds, the
            Tasker Funds will remain in the Payment Account until paid or
            otherwise for up to three months from the date the Poster initially
            paid the Agreed Price into the Payment Account.
            <br />
            5.10 Following the 3 months referred to in clause 5.6, and provided
            there is still no dispute in respect of the Tasker Funds, the Tasker
            Funds will be credited to the Poster as Stored Value.
            <br />
            5.11 If the Task Contract is cancelled and a User who is party to
            the Task Contract can show that work under a Task Contract was
            commenced, then the amount of the Agreed Price to be returned to the
            Poster will be conditional upon the mediation and dispute process in
            clause 18. However, the Cancellation Admin Fee will always be due in
            accordance with clause 5.1.

            11.4 Taklief may also take out other insurance itself and that
            insurance may at Taklief's option extend some types of cover to
            Users. Taklief reserves the right to change the terms of its
            insurance policies with the third party insurance providers at any
            time. A summary of the policies are available on the Taklief website
            and the policy details can be requested via Taklief. Users are
            responsible for familiarising themselves with these details.
            <br />
            11.5 You acknowledge and agree that in the event that a claim is
            made relating to any services performed and/or goods provided by a
            Tasker, and the insurance taken out by Taklief (if any) responds to
            that claim then this clause applies. If a claim is made against a
            Tasker, Taklief may (provided that the Tasker consents) elect to
            make a claim under any applicable policy and if the claim is
            successful, Taklief reserves its right to recover any excess or
            deductible payable in respect of the claim from the Tasker. Where
            Taklief makes a claim and the insurer assesses that the Tasker is
            responsible, Taklief is entitled to rely on that assessment. If You
            do not pay any excess due under this clause, Taklief may also elect
            to set this amount off some or all of the excess paid by it against
            future moneys it may owe to You.
            <br />
            11.6 You acknowledge and agree that in the event that a claim is
            made relating to any services performed and/or goods provided by a
            Tasker, and the insurance taken out by Taklief (if any) does not
            respond to the claim or the claim is below the excess payable to the
            insurer, then this clause applies. Taklief may elect to reject or
            pay an amount to settle a claim not covered by Taklief's own
            insurance policies. To the extent that the Tasker was or would be
            liable for the amount of the claim, if Taklief elects to pay an
            amount to settle the claim the amount paid by Taklief may be
            recovered by Taklief from the Tasker. Taklief may also elect to set
            this amount off against future moneys it may owe to the Tasker.

        <h6>MODEL TASK CONTRACT</h6>

        <p>
          The terms used in this Task Contract have the meaning set out in the
          Taklief Glossary. A Task Contract is created in accordance with the
          Taklief Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed, the Poster and the Tasker
          enter into a Task Contract on the following terms:
        </p>

        <h6>1 COMMENCEMENT DATE AND TERM</h6>

        <ul>
          <li>
            1.1 The Task Contract is created when the Poster accepts the
            Tasker's Offer on a Posted Task to provide Services. When using
            Search Assist, the Task Contract is created when the Tasker makes an
            Instant Claim.
            <br />
            1.2 The Contract will continue until terminated in accordance with
            clause 7.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h6>2 SERVICES</h6>

        <ul>
          <li>
            2.1 The Tasker will perform Services in a proper and workmanlike
            manner.
            <br />
            2.2 The Tasker must perform the Services at the time and location
            agreed.
            <br />
            2.3 The parties must perform their obligations in accordance with
            any other terms or conditions agreed by the parties during or
            subsequent to the creation of the Task Contract.
            <br />
            2.4 The parties acknowledge that the Task Contract is one of
            personal service where the Poster selected the Tasker to perform the
            Services. Therefore the Tasker must not subcontract any part of the
            Services to any third party without the Poster's consent.
            <br />
            2.5 The Tasker remains responsible and liable at all times to the
            Poster for any acts or omissions of a subcontractor as if those acts
            or omissions had been made by the Tasker.
